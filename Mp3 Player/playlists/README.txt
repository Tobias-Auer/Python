With this mp3 player you can create an infinite number of playlists.
Just create another folder and put the mp3 files in it.
The two existing playlists are only two copies and can be deleted if desired.


If you right click on the small music icon, you can select any song from your playlist and it will play infinitely.

You can also press Shuffle and a random song from your playlist will be selected. When that song ends, another random song from that playlist will start.

You can pause and resume the song with a left click on the icon.
